\section*{Thanks}
It would not have been possible to carry out this thesis to this extent without the active support of a number of people. We would therefore like to thank everyone who supported us in the implementation of this thesis, especially our supervisor Prof DI Johannes Loibner, BSc for the intense cooperation, our project partner Prof. DU Robert Müllerferli that provided us the initial idea and the test users, Lisa and Kathrin Müllerferli, Jasmin Kormann and Eva Reßmann for the constructive feedback.\\
