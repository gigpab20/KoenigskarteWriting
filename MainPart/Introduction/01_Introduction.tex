Mobile Apps get used for quite literally everything in today's World. So after we noticed that there is no application that allows the efficient planning of campaigns like the "Sternsinger-Aktion" we asked ourselves why, and furthermore, how hard it would be, to create an App with intuitive Usability for the sole purpose of simplifying the process of managing such a campaign and gaining a general overview of the progress made.

The app needs to comply with some criteria we defined in cooperation with Prof. DI Robert Müllerferli. He is the main organizer of the campaign in the parish of Lieboch and helped us to make out the key aspects our project should implement. In the finished product, every user should be able to scan a QR-Code, through which the area of this group gets assigned to the device. These areas must be adjustable on the fly, so admin can coordinate the visits more easily. It should be visible at a glance if there is a "specification", which can be assigned by admins, set for an address. This should be realized through the use of different icons instead of the default marker. Apart from the app itself, we also implemented a web-portal through which administrators can manage and supervise the campaign.

The research part of this thesis will be dedicated to how components should act and look, so that new users can use this tool without requiring a long "onboarding" phase. It should feel familiar to interact with elements and the borders of what users can and can't do need to be clearly defined. Because our application also needs a somewhat reliable data source to guarantee the consistency and accuracy of marked addresses in our app, we researched ways to keep our database up-to-date, without the need of much manual intervention. After defining the projects requirements, we noticed that we need to somehow calculate which addresses are "Border" addresses. So we decided to take a look into different algorithms for this task and compare them concerning their efficiency and then decide on one of them and implement it.

This thesis contains an in-depth description of our thought and development
process, as well as any other steps we took to achieve our goal of a
functional mobile application that can be used by volunteers in course of the
"Sternsinger-Aktion 2025" taking place in the parish of Lieboch.
