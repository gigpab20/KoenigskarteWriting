\section{Final Thoughts}

\subsection{Leon Edlinger}
I am happy and proud about the results of this project. Because of this thesis, I have learned a lot of new interesting things and gained a lot of experience. I am very grateful to my colleagues and my supervisor for their support and help. Hopefully our software will be useful in the future for the Sternsinger-Aktion and help to make this event modern and more efficient.
