\subsection{Leon Edlinger}
I am happy and proud about the results of this project. Because of this thesis, I have learned a lot of new interesting things and gained a lot of experience. I am very grateful to my colleagues and my supervisor for their support and help. Hopefully our software will be useful in the future for the Sternsinger-Aktion and help to make this event modern and more efficient.

\subsection{Paul Gigler}

I think that through the course of this thesis I got a pretty good impression of what is like to cooperatively develop a real software-product. Despite some organizational troubles, I think we did a great job of developing a software that meets all the important criteria. 

\subsection{Andreas Weissl}

This project offered a chance to deepen my knowledge of Spring Boot while getting actual hands-on experience. I enjoyed overcoming challenges, which encouraged me to create some creative solutions. The research on the convex hull algorithm was particularly interesting, as I have always enjoyed working with theoretical mathematical ideas. I am grateful to my supervisor and colleagues for their support whenever I needed help. I got a lot of valuable knowledge throughout this project and hope that our application will contribute to making the caroler campaign more modern and efficient.
