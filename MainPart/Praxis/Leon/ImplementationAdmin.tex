The Admin Panel is a Flutter-based administrative dashboard that allows the administrator to efficiently manage all addresses in the application, to plan  future "Sternsinger" events and assign designated zones to groups. This zoning ensures organized distribution of participants. It enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on addresses, streets and zones. These features make it easy for the administrator to quickly address issues and make changes to areas that participants need to visit.

\subsection{Page Navigation}

The file \texttt{AdminNavigation.dart} is used to manage the navigation between the different pages of the Admin Panel. It is a stateful widget that contains a list of pages and a function to navigate to a specific page. The navigation is a sidebar on the left which can be set visible via a  button on the top left of the screen.
