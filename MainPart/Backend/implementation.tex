    \section{Implementation}
    The backend implementation combines theoretical concepts with practical solutions to ensure functionality and scalability.

    \subsection{Config of Spring Boot (application.properties)}
    The \texttt{application.properties} file configures essential settings, including database connections, logging, and server parameters.

    \subsection{Entity Classes (Structure/Purpose)}
    Entity classes define the application's data model, using annotations to map fields to database tables.

    \subsection{JpaRepositories (DB Access and CRUD Operations)}
    Repositories simplify database access by providing methods for CRUD operations and enabling custom queries.

    \subsection{Service Classes}
    Service classes encapsulate business logic, coordinating data flow between controllers and repositories.

    \subsection{Rest Controller (API Endpoints and their Functions)}
    REST controllers define API endpoints, processing requests and returning responses to ensure seamless interaction with the frontend.
