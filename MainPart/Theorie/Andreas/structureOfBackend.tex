    The backend follows a layered architecture to promote separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. This section outlines the roles of each layer.

    \subsection{Controller Layer}
    The controller layer acts as the interface for incoming HTTP requests, delegating them to appropriate service methods.

    \subsection{Service Layer}
    The service layer contains business logic, validating data and coordinating interactions between controllers and repositories.

    \subsection{Repository Layer}
    Repositories abstract database operations, allowing the backend to interact with the database without explicit SQL queries.

    \subsection{Persistence Layer (Entity Classes)}
    Entity classes define the data model and its mapping to the relational database, ensuring a consistent schema.

    \subsection{Applied Design Principles (DTOs)}
    Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) enhance encapsulation and optimize data transfer between layers and external clients.
