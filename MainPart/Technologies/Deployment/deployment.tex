\subsubsection{Docker}
Docker is a tool for containerization and one of the most popular options in this field. Through containerization, it is possible to isolate a process from the host machine, in a virtual environment. Furthermore, docker is portable which makes it a great choice for software projects that many developers with different environments work on. It is used to create a controlled infrastructure which guarantees the correct configuration for the production server. We used Docker to host our PostgreSQL database across multiple different systems throughout the development process.
