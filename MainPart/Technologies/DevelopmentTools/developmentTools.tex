\subsubsection{VS Code}
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a version of the Code-OSS project with Microsoft-specific customizations included, which makes it a closed-source product licensed by Microsoft. VS Code is highly customizable, with support for community made plugins and many opportunities for the user to define how things should act and look. \autocite{VSCode:readMe} There are also many handy features implemented out of the box, like native VCS support. Due to the fact VS Code is an electron based application, it can not only be used on a desktop computer, but also directly in the browser of any device. \autocite{VSCode:electron} \autocite{VSCode:web}

\subsubsection{IntelliJ}
IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE primarily designed for Java and Kotlin developers, published by JetBrains. In comparison to VS Code, it is much heavier with the reason being the included tools like the direct integration of a database connection via the embedded DataGrip version. It is the base framework used for other, more specific IDEs by JetBrains, like Android Studio, WebStorm or DataGrip. Its functionality can also be extended by making use of plugins. \autocite{IntelliJ:JetBrains} \autocite{IntelliJ:Wikipedia}

\subsubsection{Android Studio}
Android Studio is based on the IntelliJ framework, but, as the name suggests, with the specification to developing Android apps. Aside from Java and Kotlin based pure Android apps, it can also be used for developing cross-platform applications using the flutter framework. The IDE introduced by Google also features an Emulator for Pixel devices which simplifies testing. Last but not least it provides an intuitive way to compile the app and flash it to a physical Android device using ADB and USB-debugging.

\subsubsection{Postman}
Postman is an API platform, mainly used to test APIs.  It features collaboration and an automatic code-generation, so you can design the request you want to make in postman and Technologies export it into any of the supported languages. We used it to develop and test our API, without a frontend application to minimize the points of failure.
