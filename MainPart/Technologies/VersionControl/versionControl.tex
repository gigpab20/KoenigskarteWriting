\subsubsection{Git}
Git is a distributed VCS that was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005. The main benefit of a VCS is to easily keep track of different versions of files. Git is the most widely used option, concerning this area of application.  \autocite{Git:survey} This is due to the fact it is open-source, therefore free, as well as reliable and easy to learn. It gets used in almost every, but not only, development project, not just for tracking the history of files, but also for developing cooperatively making use of it's branching feature. This allows for development while maintaining a stable version on the main branch. \autocite{Git:branching}
