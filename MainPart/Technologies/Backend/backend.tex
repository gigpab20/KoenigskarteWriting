\subsubsection{Java Spring}

Java on its own is an object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform-independent. It allows programs to run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine installed. Java is particularly useful for its strong security features and extensive community support.

      Java Spring is an open-source framework based on Java. The Java Spring Framework is an in-depth programming and configuration language that simplifies the development of Java applications. The most used Spring Framework is Spring Boot. Spring Boot simplifies the application process with not much need for preconfigured logic. Other Spring Frameworks that have a huge impact on Java programming are Spring Security for authentication/authorization and Spring Data for database injection. 
      
      We chose Java Spring as our backend development tool because of its simplicity and flexibility. As a framework, Spring allowed us to develop a well-scalable and maintainable backend to generate APIs and connect to the database.

      PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is known for its reliability and scalability. It complies with the SQL standard. Databases, which use PostgreSQL, are designed to handle a huge amount of data efficiently. These databases support more advanced features like full-text search and JSON data storage. One of PostgreSQL's strengths is its flexibility. Developers are able to create custom data types and functions to customize the database to their specific needs. It also provides security mechanisms, which include role-based access control and encryption.
