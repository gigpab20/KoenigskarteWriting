\subsubsection{Java Spring}
Java on its own is a object-orinted programming language which is designed to be platform-independent. It allows programs to run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine installed. Java is particularly useful for its strong security features and extensive community support.

Java Spring is a open-source framework and is based on Java. The Java Spring Framework is an in-depth programming and configuration language that simplifies development of Java applications. The most used Spring Framework is Spring Boot. Spring Boot simplifies the application process with not much need for preconfigured logic. Other Spring Frameworks which have a huge impact on Java programming are Spring Security for authentication/authorization and Spring Data for database injection. 
We selected Java Spring as our backend development tool because of its simplicity and flexibility. As a framework, Spring allowed us to develop a well scalable and maintainable backend to generate APIs and connect to the database.       

\subsubsection{PostgreSQL}
PostgreSQL is a open-source relational database management system. It is known for its reliability and scalability. It complies with SQL standard. Databases which use PostgreSQL are designed to handle a huge amount of data efficiently. Those databases support more advanced features such as full-text search and JSON data storage.

One of PostgreSQL's strengths is its flexibleness. Developers are able to create custom data types and functions to customize the database to their specfic needs. It also provides security mechanisms which include role-based access control and encryption.

We used PostgreSQL in our project as our database due to its ability to handle complex queries and its scalability which then allowed us to manage and store all the data reliably.
